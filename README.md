# 2048 Solver

### Preface

The motivation behind this project came from theories behind the popular 2048 puzzle game. I often heard that to beat the game all you had to do was repeat a few moves over and over. Therfore I made this project to try and disprove that.

### Summary

This project uses selenium to quickly simulate multiple games of 2048 using various move sets. The final scores of each game are stored and an average is found for each move set.

### Results

No matter what sequence of move you repeat it is **extremely** unlikely that you will be able to solve the puzzle game 2048 using repitition alone.
